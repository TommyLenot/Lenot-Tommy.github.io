	<h1>CS1030 Lenot, Tommy</h1>
	<h2>Data Tools:</h2>
	<p>In this module, I learned about different data tools and how to use them to clean, organize and visualize data. I learned about spreadsheets and how to use Excel to sort, filter, and group data. I also learned about databases and SQL, and how to use SQL to manipulate and extract data from databases. Lastly, I learned about data visualization and how to use charts and graphs to represent data in a meaningful way.</p>
    
    <h2>Big Data:</h2>
<p>In this module, I learned about what big data is and how it is collected, stored, and analyzed. I learned about the three V's of big data - Volume, Velocity, and Variety. I also learned about Hadoop, a software framework used for distributed storage and processing of big data. Lastly, I learned about some of the challenges associated with big data, such as privacy concerns, biases in the data, and the need for powerful computational resources.</p>

<h2>Bias in Machine Learning:</h2>
<p>In this module, I learned about the issue of bias in machine learning and how it can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. I learned about different types of bias, such as selection bias, confirmation bias, and algorithmic bias. I also learned about strategies to mitigate bias in machine learning, such as data preprocessing, model interpretability, and fairness metrics.</p>

<h2>Unit Test:</h2>
<p>The unit test was a helpful way to assess my understanding of the topics covered in the modules. The questions were a mix of multiple choice and short answer, and they required me to recall and apply the concepts I learned. Overall, I found the test to be challenging but fair, and I think it was a good way to reinforce my learning.</p>

  <h2>Heart Failure Prediction Dataset</h2>
  <p>The dataset used is called "Heart Failure Prediction Dataset" from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets</a>. After downloading and opening it in Excel, one of the questions that was investigated was whether there were any correlations between age, gender, and cholesterol levels that could hint at the type of heart failure a patient had. To answer this question, the filter and sort function was used to find the relevant data. The dataset consisted of 918 individuals and their data on the type of heart failure they had. I then also used google sheets that would then import the Excel sheet because I was more familiar with using it for charts or other graphical data.</p>
  <p>After filtering the "ChestPainType" column, it was found that out of the 918 individuals, 496 had ASY, 173 had ATA, 203 had NAP, and 46 had TA. It was also found that 508 people had a heart disease or condition. Further testing was done by changing the filter settings to see who had cholesterol levels over 200 and age grouping by having 5 distinct groups that were people under 40, people in their 40s, 50s, 60s, and anyone who were in their 70s and older.</p>
  <p>After changing the filter settings, it was found that there were 600 people in total who had cholesterol levels over or equal to 200. There were 80 people under 40, 211 were in their 40s, 374 were in their 50s, 222 were in their 60s, and 31 were 70 years old or older. Of the total, 725 were male and 193 were female. Anyone over or equal to the cholesterol level of 200 is considered to have high cholesterol levels, which can greatly affect their chances of having heart failure or other chest complications.</p>
  <p>To investigate each group more specifically, it was necessary to see which group had more types of Chest Pains than others, who had more individuals with cholesterol levels above or equal to 200, and the gender quantity. Starting with the group of people under 40 and going down to the last group of 70 years old or older, the filter settings were constantly changed for age, gender, chest pain type, and cholesterol columns.</p>
  <p>For the group of people under 40, there were 80 people, 61 were male, 19 were female, and overall, 48 of them had cholesterol levels over 200. Further analysis showed that of the 27 individuals who had ASY, 13 had cholesterol levels at or over 200 and 12 of them were men while 1 was a woman. 14 of them had cholesterol levels under 200, and 9 of them were males and 5 were females. Of the 27 individuals with ATA, 22 had cholesterol levels 200+ and 18 of them were males and 4 were females, while 5 people were under the 200 cholesterol level, of which 3 were males and 2 were females. 20 people from that group had NAP, of which 11 had cholesterol levels 200+, 8 of them were male, and 3 were female, and 9 people had cholesterol levels below 200, of which 7 were males and 2 were females. 6 people had TA, of which 4 were male and 2 female.</p>

<div>
<p>The next group was people in their 40s of which we started the same process all over again and 211 people were in this group of which 159 of them were males, 52 females, and overall 154 people’s cholesterol level were 200+. 99 of them had ASY of which 85 of them were males and 14 females and that 72 of them had high cholesterol levels and that 59 of them were male and 13 females, overall in this sub group had of which 49 of them had heart diseases and the other 27 people who didn’t had high cholesterol, the majority of them had heart diseases as well and that 26 were male and 1 was female. There were 54 individuals in their 40s that had ATA of which 43 of them had had high cholesterol and there 25 males and 18 females and those who didn’t had high cholesterol levels were 11 individuals being made of 6 males and 5 females. 50 individuals in their 40s had NAP and were made of 36 males and 14 females, of which of which 33 of them had high cholesterol levels and that 23 of them were male and 10 were female and those under high cholesterol levels were 17 people comprised of 13 males and 4 females. 8 people had TA of which 7 of them were male and 1 was female and that and that out of 8 of them only 2 males did not have high cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>The largest age group of all was people in their 50s of which the dataset shows 374 individuals and that overall 207 had high cholesterol levels passing over 200. 207 of them had ASY, 182 of them were male and 25 female, 128 of them had high cholesterol levels of which 107 were male and 21 were female and that 79 were under the 200 cholesterol level which were 75 males, and 4 females. 75 individuals had ATA of which 49 were male and 26 were female of which 58 of them had high cholesterol levels, 34 of them were male and 24 were female, while those under the high cholesterol threshold were 17 individuals which had 15 males and 2 females. 80 individuals had NAP of which 61 were male and 19 were female, which had 52 of them had cholesterol levels over 200 and 35 of them were male and 17 of them were female, while 28 of them were under 200 and that 26 of them were male and 2 were female. 12 people had TA which had 10 males and 2 females of which 9 of them had cholesterol levels over 200 of which were 7 males and 2 females while only 3 individuals were under the 200 cholesterol level of which were all male.</p>
</div>


<p>The next group were those people in their 60s which comprised of 222 people which comprised of 178 males, 44 females, and that overall, 133 of them had cholesterol levels over 200 and that 100 of them were male and the rest were 33 females. 147 had ASY of which 123 of them were male and 24 were female, 83 of them had cholesterol levels over 200 of which 65 of them were male and 18 were female, while 64 of them were under 200 which comprised of 58 males and 6 females. There were only 13 individuals who had ATA of which 10 of them were male, 3 females, and that 9 of them had high cholesterol levels which comprised of 8 males and 1 female while the other 4 individuals were under the 200 cholesterol level and that half were male and the other half was female. 43 people had NAP of which 31 were male, 12 were female, overall 28 of them had high cholesterol levels, that of which 17 were male, 11 were female, and that the 15 others were under the high cholesterol level and that all, but one were male. 19 people had TA of which 14 were male, 5 were female, 13 of them had high cholesterol levels of which 10 of them were male and 3 were female, and those under the high cholesterol level comprised of 6 people, 4 of which were male and the other 2 were female.</p>
<p>Finally we had the smallest group which were 31 people who were in their 70s or older, 25 of them were male and 6 were female, and overall, 18 of them had high cholesterol levels. 16 of them had ASY, all but one were male, 9 of them had high cholesterol levels which were all male and 7 individuals under the high cholesterol level of which 6 were male and one was female. 4 people at ATA of which half were male and the other half was female, 3 of them had cholesterol levels over 200 and that 2 of them were female and 1 was male, and the other male did not have any cholesterol levels as it was shown from their data that he had a heart disease so it may not have been cholesterol related. 10 people had NAP of which 7 were male and 3 were female, 5 of them had high cholesterol levels which comprised of 4 males and 1 female, the other 5 were under the high cholesterol level of which 3 of them were male and the other 2 were female. And finally we had only one Male who had TA of which his cholesterol level.</p>

 <h3>Conclusion</h3>

<div>
After filtering out the data there was a conclusion to the formulated question, in that it is more likely that males would suffer more of a heart failure than females as in each age group and sub categories that I search through there was more male than female ratio. Overall, 600 people had high cholesterol levels that were greater or equal to 200 which can lead to the conclusion that most patients who suffer a heart failure of any type is most likely going to have high cholesterol. Age factor seems to be that while it can affect anyone at any age range, it seems more occurring to those who are in their 50s more often, followed by people in the 40s, and then 60s as in the dataset only a small portion of people outside of those age ranges were in this data so it can be speculated that anyone before or past those ages are most likely not going to have a heart failure as often as in those age groups at are more affected. Now it can be said that Heart diseases also may attribute to the type of heart failure they will have and what type of chest pain they get as 508 people out of 918 which is a 55 percent of the data records in this dataset had at least a heart disease. Finally, it is most likely that the type of chest pain an individual will have before having their heart failure come into effect is AYS or asymptomatic of which it does not have any symptoms or any signs that the individual could show that they are having a heart failure so that the fact that is occurs could mean that doctors could and should encourage regular checkups and ways to lower down their patient’s cholesterol levels.
