<p>The next group were those people in their 60s which comprised of 222 people which comprised of 178 males, 44 females, and that overall, 133 of them had cholesterol levels over 200 and that 100 of them were male and the rest were 33 females. 147 had ASY of which 123 of them were male and 24 were female, 83 of them had cholesterol levels over 200 of which 65 of them were male and 18 were female, while 64 of them were under 200 which comprised of 58 males and 6 females.

 <h3>Conclusion</h3>

<div>
After filtering out the data there was a conclusion to the formulated question, in that it is more likely that males would suffer more of a heart failure than females as in each age group and sub categories that I search through there was more male than female ratio. Overall, 600 people had high cholesterol levels that were greater or equal to 200 which can lead to the conclusion that most patients who suffer a heart failure of any type is most likely going to have high cholesterol. Age factor seems to be that while it can affect anyone at any age range, it seems more occurring to those who are in their 50s more often, followed by people in the 40s, and then 60s as in the dataset only a small portion of people outside of those age ranges were in this data so it can be speculated that anyone before or past those ages are most likely not going to have a heart failure as often as in those age groups at are more affected. Now it can be said that Heart diseases also may attribute to the type of heart failure they will have and what type of chest pain they get as 508 people out of 918 which is a 55 percent of the data records in this dataset had at least a heart disease. Finally, it is most likely that the type of chest pain an individual will have before having their heart failure come into effect is AYS or asymptomatic of which it does not have any symptoms or any signs that the individual could show that they are having a heart failure so that the fact that is occurs could mean that doctors could and should encourage regular checkups and ways to lower down their patientâ€™s cholesterol levels.
